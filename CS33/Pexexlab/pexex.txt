I first run the gdb of the file:
gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2

Then I set the breakpoint at Ftimes:
(gdb) break Ftimes

Then I use the command to show the assembly code:
(gdb) set disassemble-next-line-on

Then I use the command to trace the work I did:
(gdb) set logging on

Then I started gdb:
run -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'

During the process, I use 'step' and 'next' to go through the codes in Ftimes
and arith_driver as the Ftimes return the function arith_driver:

And I check the registers and memory when they are updated:
info registers
x/g address

And I make those trace to my trace.tr
