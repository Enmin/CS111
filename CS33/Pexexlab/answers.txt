1.
In the trace, the wrong answer starts from here:

547920	48 8d 04 ad 02 00 00 00	lea 0x2(,%rbp,4),%rax	rax=7fffffff73ab3b42

In the rbp, the value is "dfffffffdceaced0", which is correct answer
of the multiplication of "1250284240 -1844255039". However, it shifts
the rbp to left by 2 and then add 2 to it, so the last 2 bits is "10", and the
correct number is changed. So the final result is modified. Though after
some codes, the result is shited right by 2, but the return value is not
the correct arithmatic value. And the final result is a result of 
overflow error. (2305843008625102544, wrong result)

2.
As the operation done above, the final result is firstly shifted to left
by 2 and then shifted back again with arithmatic shift, so the total
bits used by the Elisp is 62. So the most negative value is 
-2^61, which is -2305843009213693952

3.
When I checked the comand:

emacs -Q -batch -eval '(print (* most-positive-fixnum most-positive-fixnum))'

also ouputs 1, it must be the overflow problem of Elisp.
The most-positive-fixnum of Elisp is 2305843009213693951, which is 2^61-1.
the squaring of 0x1fff ffff ffff ffff is 0x3ff ffff ffff ffff c000 0000 0000 0001. Therefore the result 62 bits left is 1, and square of 1 is also 1.
So the final output is 1.

4.
It would not change anything because the Elisp had already implemented
the wrapping of overflow problems. So -fwrapv would not change anything.

5.
On the second time around the
time zone format string start points to already allocated memory from
the previous function call. On the second iteration the source string and
destination string point to the same block of memory and share one terminating
character. The destination string is slightly ahead of the source. Thus when
copying, strcpy writes over the terminating character and keeps writing
infinitely. This quickly uses up all the available memory and causes the
segmentation fault. The function that calls strcpy is emacs_setenv_TZ in
editfns.c.
